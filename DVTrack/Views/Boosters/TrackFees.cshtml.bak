    <p>
        Thank you for your support!
        Booster membership is one of the reasons we have such an outstanding program.
        2019 Program Support Fees are $75.
        This fee helps us pay for all the items big and small that our district does not cover with your $50 activity fee.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our prefered method of payment is to our <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tempeunion.org/domain/72">Tax Credit account</a></strong>.
        Even if you have contributed your maximum refundable amount, you can still direct your program support fees to this account.
        Once logged in, select your student and click "Items At Student's School".
        Scroll towards the bottom of the page to find "TAX CREDIT - TRACK".
        We are requesting a minimum of $75, but you can elect up to the maximum allowable refundable amount.
        For more information about these funds, or to request a copy of our financials, please send us an <strong><a href="mailto:boosters@dvtrack.com">email</a></strong>
